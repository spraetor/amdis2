AMDiS 2.0

A complete cleanup of the old AMDiS 0.9 version. Anything is based on Expressions. 
C++11 is now standard. 
AbstractFunctions will be replaced, by expressions, or std::functions.
Possibly c++11-Lambda epxressions are supported.
A lot of deprecated and unused features are removed. Serialization is removed completely.
